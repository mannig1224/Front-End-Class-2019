# Front-End-Class-2019
Some of the projects I worked on from my CS 213 Class. Most projects work fine on browser but later assignments (from 11 and above) need PHP to be installed in your computer to work and a web server.
Most projects on this semester focues on the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Form Validation, Basics of Design, Responsive Web Design, JSON and AJAX.
You will see implentations of all above examples in the projects.
